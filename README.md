# MIST: MIMIC Interactive Summarization Tool

### Overview
**MIST** is a clinical NLP research pipeline designed to transform fragmented Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from the **MIMIC-IV** dataset into structured, longitudinal patient "Lifelines." 

By utilizing local Large Language Models (LLMs) via **Ollama**, MIST synthesizes complex medical histories—including ICD-10 diagnoses and prescriptions—into a standardized chronological format.
